# Advanced-Deep-Learning-Models-And-Methods
Implementation of the project "Anomaly detection using Contrastive Predictive Coding" for "Advanced Deep Learning Models And Methods" course.

We implemented a working algorithm that makes anomaly detection on images using Contrastive Predictive Coding.
We reached good results, comparing them using different encoder architectures such as ResNet-18-v2, ResNet50-v2, and Densenet.

Since we worked on Kaggle we suggest to open the notebooks there.
